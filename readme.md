# Project Name

## Description

This project is a Weather API that provides real-time weather data for a given location. It utilizes a third-party weather API to fetch the weather information and returns it in a standardized format.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Obtain an API key from the weather service provider.

5. Start the server by running `npm start`.

## Usage

To use the Weather API, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /weather?location={location}
```

Replace `{location}` with the desired location for which you want to retrieve the weather information.

The API will respond with a JSON object containing the weather data for the specified location.
